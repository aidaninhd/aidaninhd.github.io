                Our website is dedicated to documenting the history of cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions, with a special focus on Sony’s innovations and the iconic Trinitron. 
                We explore the technological advancements that made CRTs dominant in the 20th century and discuss their decline with the advent of modern displays. 
                While many view these once-loved devices as obsolete, they represent an important chapter in the history of consumer electronics.

                In addition to showcasing the fascinating history of CRTs, we also highlight the environmental dangers they pose if improperly disposed of. 
                These heavy, bulky devices contain harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, which can have long-lasting effects on the environment when they end up in landfills. 
                Our mission is to inform and educate the public about the safe disposal options available and the reasons why it’s critical to do so.

                    Our site will also provide practical information, including locations of recycling centers in the Carolinas that accept CRTs, and a community-driven survey 
                    to learn more about how people have managed the disposal of these devices.
